# About Me

My name is Sara Zangi, I typically go by Zangi, and I'm a junior in course 22, who is interested in fusion engineering.

I'm mostly interested in magnet engineering and engineering materials resistant to plasma damage. I've worked on projects related to modelling heat transfer of superconducting magnets and engineering sensors resistant to damage from plasmas.
	I currently work as a nuclear reactor operator at MIT's Nuclear Reactor Lab, a research reactor used by our nuclear science department for various research for the last 50 years!

Outside of course work, I also enjoy hiking and rock climbing as well as being involved in student government.
