## Week 4 - Sub-team Design Constraints Narrowed and Pin-Ups
</br>
<h4> Cooking Sub-Team</h4>

Moving into week four, the cooking sub-team began focusing on identifying the design constraints which would arise from the
	goal of designing a surface for cooking. We began by identifying 3 test meals which we used as metrics from which it
	could be determined what was necessary to successfully cook food on an outdoor surface. From this thought experiment
	we determined that three broad categories of constraints were necessary:

* Type of cooking
* Level of heat
* Speed of heat change

Once we identified the broad categories of constraints we began to brainstorm the exact constraints we would need and what
	potential design solutions that would meet those constraints would look like.

<h4> Type of Cooking</h4>

Test meals of grilled chicken kabobs, grilled beef, tomatoes and rice, and a quinoa based Tex Mex style dish, were
	used to determine our constraints. For all of these we quickly realized the common denominator of how heat was provided
	would be a hot cooking surface, such as one provided by a grill, or diner style flat top, rather than a heated space,
	such as an oven, or pressure cooker.

This led us to determine that the optimal cooking surface would be diner style flat top, ideally approximately 2 ft x 5 ft,
	to maximize the amount of cooking that could be accomplished at once, but with the size open to change.

<h4> Level of Heat</h4>

Levels of heat that will be required to heat the grill were again determined using our test meals as bases.<br>
To fully cook chicken, an internal temperature of at least 145 <sup>o</sup>F is required, which requires a surface temp of at least 325 <sup> o</sup>F.
To fully cook beef, an internal temperature of at least 160 <sup>o</sup>F is required, which requires a surface temp of at least 350-375 <sup>o</sup>F.
However, most beef also requires a sear, which requires surface temperatures of up to 400 <sup>o</sup>F. This gives us the upper bound of the temperatures
	which we want for our grill to be able to achieve.

For cooking the vegetables required for all of these dishes, one generally wants a steady level of heat delivery at approximately the temperature
	which the food should eventually reach. As most vegetables are cooked at around the boiling point of water, this would
	yield a lower temperature requirement of around 212 <sup>o</sup>F.

Combining these requirements, we find that we need a cook top surface which is capable of providing different levels of heat,
	either at different times, or in different spaces, with heating requirements of:

* 212 <sup>o</sup>F
* 325 <sup>o</sup>F
* 350 <sup>o</sup>F
* 400 <sup>o</sup>F

This either necessitates a single small cooking surface, or a larger cooking surface with different areas capable of providing
	constant amounts of heat at different levels, i.e. a flat top with a hot section, a warm section, and a cool section.


<h4> Speed of Heat Change</h4>

If the way in which variable heat delivery is provided is through changing the temperature of the entire cook top, there will
	need to be constraints on the speed at which the heating level of the surface changes temperature, as a grill which takes
	20 min to go from 400 <sup>o</sup>F to 350 <sup>o</sup>F is of very little practical use for cooking multiple things.

The constraints we determined for this were based on going from a sear to a regualar meat cooking level, which gave us
	a minimum temperature change speed of 0.833 <sup>o</sup>F/sec.
