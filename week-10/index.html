## Week 10 - Prototyping and Further Modelling
</br>
<h4> Solar Collection and Transport</h4>

In week 10, we focused mainly on beginning to prototype our design. In order to begin to prototype we needed to work out
	the final designs we want to utilize for the solar transfer mechanism, specifically if we wanted to stay with using a bounce
	mirror or directly project the beam onto the solar battery without a secondary bounce surface as an intermediary. We
	also finished designing the mounting mechanism for mounting the solar collector onto it's supporting axel in a way
	which will allow the motors to rotate the dish throughout the day.

We also finished designing the system by which the motors connect to and rotate the solar collector. After considering several
	mounting systems and attachment methods such as gearing systems and worm screws, we have determined that a simple belt
	method with the motors mounted on the rotating plate is the best method for changing the elevation angle of the solar
	collector.

<h5> Solar Collector Mount</h5>

As the solar collector shell will be built from hardening resin and burlap, we have determined that we can 3D print our
	mounting brackets and directly set the brackets into the resin as it hardens to attach the brackets to the solar
	collector. The main design constraint beyond the need to fit onto the collector and to hold the axel was that the
	bracket should be designed in such a way that the collector could be detached from the axel without having to pull
	the axel out through both brackets.

The simplest solution to this was to design the mounting brackets in a manner similar to C-clamps, with a screw applying
	pressure to the axel once it has slotted into its mounting point, and both keeping the axel attached to the collector
	and preventing the axel from rotating in the bracket. By forcing the axel to be static relative to the collector, we
	have also met the design constraint that the solar collector needs to rotate with our axel so that our solar tracking
	system will be able to function. A 3D model of the bracket is shown below.

Additionally, we have determined that the axel bearings on the support posts should be ball bearings mounted in angle brackets,
	as opposed to pillow bearings as originally intended. This is due to the price of pillow bearings relative to most ball
	bearings as well as the relative availability of the standard ball bearings. A CAD model of the new joint method is shown below.

Other members of the solar tracking team refined the energy transfer mechanism, and decided to scrap the bounce mirror idea
	in leu of directly shining the beam onto the side of the molten salt battery which is exposed. A picture of our current
	full assembly is shown below.

<h4> Prototyping</h4>

This week we also began prototyping important parts of our design in the beaverworks shop. We began by laser cutting the
	gears we will need to rotate the base of the solar collector from various widths of delrin, a plastic polymer, to determine
	the laser cutter's efficacy in fabricating the parts we need. From this we have determined that our gears will best
	be constructed of two laminated gears of 0.2" delrin, as opposed to one piece of 0.375" delrin as we initially planned.

We also began laser cutting the parts necessary to construct the plywood base and motor housing which the solar collector
	and molten salt battery assemblies rest on. We encountered a few challenges with cutting the plywood of a necessary
	thickness in the lase cutter, but eventually we were successful, and the results of our prototyping are shown below.

Pictured here is the plywood base, which corresponds to the 24" circular discs as well as the central motor housing pictured
	in the CAD of our assembly shown above.
