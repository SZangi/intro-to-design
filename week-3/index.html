## Week 3 - Focused Brainstorming, and Design Goal Chosen

Our broad goal for the project this term is constructing an intervention which will capture renewable energy and use it
	in a way which benefits the community, or demonstrates the power of renewable sources. To accomplish this goal we have
	seperated into three design sub-teams, each with a different focus area.

<h3> Design Sub-Teams</h3>
</br>
<h4>Energy Collection </h4>

The energy collection sub-team is focusing on how we want to collect energy. They began with a variety of potential
energy sources and evaluated the pros and cons of each including but not limited to, energy density, ease of collection, and
reliability as a source of energy.
	Our initial energy types included:

* Geothermal
* Solar (PV)
* Direct Solar (Solar mirrors, solar ovens, water heaters, etc.)
* Residual Heat (Compost, Sewage, etc.)
* Wind
* Rain

After deliberating on the benefits, feasiblity, and usefulness of each, we have decided to pursue a direct solar powered
energy intervention, and will be planning around using that as our energy source. The exact manner in which we will collect the energy
is still to be determined and this sub-team will focus on developing that further going forwards.


<h4>Energy Storage</h4>

The energy storage sub-team is focusing on how the energy which is delivered by the energy capture team will be stored
and delivered to the energy usage sub-team. Several ideas have been proposed which mesh well with our proposed energy capture
method of direct solar, and the team will be working on narrowing down their prospects and choosing a specific idea
to deliver the energy to the use sub-team in the future.

Current energy storage ideas include:

* Chemical Batteries
* Fuel Cells
* Heat reservoirs
* Kinetic energy batteries
* Gravitation potential energy batteries


The current frontrunner in terms of being feasible to build with the limitations we have on our space while still being
useful as a form of energy storage is hydrolysis fuel cells, as basic ones can be easily constructed, and they store large
amounts of energy.

<h4>Energy Usage & Team Management</h4>

The energy usage sub-team is focused on determining how we actually use the energy which is collected by the intervention. This is the team which I am on. Based on initial brainstorming
this group mainly focused on heating based intervention uses and electricity based intervention uses.

Initial use ideas include:

* Electric Bike
* Water heaters
* AC units
* Building heating
* Bike charger
* Renewable powered lighting

After the energy collection direction was cemented, we focused specifically on interventions which could easily use
solar powered heat, such as solar ovens, and have been compiling various precedents for direct solar powered heating.
