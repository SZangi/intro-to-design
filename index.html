<h1> Project Overview</h1>
<p> The goal for our team this semester will be to design a device or structure which will capture energy from
the environment, and convert it to a form of energy which can be usefully consumed by the community.
    <br>
    <br> The overall goal of our project is to create a working prototype of our design by the end of the semester.
    <br>
    <br> In order to accomplish this we will be splitting into teams which will focus on designing smaller segments of the overall
    design. These teams will focus on energy capture and distribution, mechanical design, material selection, and other
    physical design components, as well as management and team integration.
