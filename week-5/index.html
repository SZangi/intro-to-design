## Week 5 - Sub-team Design Constraints Narrowed and Pin-Ups
</br>
<h4> Overview</h4>

Moving into week five, we determined that the method we would be using for energy collection would be a molten salt battery
	and confirmed that the technology to build and use a molten salt battery was within the scope of our project. We also
	subdivided the teams further to a design integration subteam responsible for moving the energy between collection,
	energy, and cooking, as well as making sure that each team's design will meet the constraints given by each subsequent
	team.
