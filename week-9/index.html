## Week 9 - Concept Redesign and Further Modelling
</br>
<h4> Solar Collection and Transport</h4>

In week 10, we focused mainly on beginning to prototype our design. In order to begin to prototype we needed to work out
	the final designs we want to utilize for the solar transfer mechanism, specifically if we wanted to stay with using a bounce
	mirror or directly project the beam onto the solar battery without a secondary bounce surface as an intermediary. We
	also finished designing the mounting mechanism for mounting the solar collector onto it's supporting axel in a way
	which will allow the motors to rotate the dish throughout the day.

We also finished designing the system by which the motors connect to and rotate the solar collector. After considering several
	mounting systems and attachment methods such as gearing systems and worm screws, we have determined that a simple belt
	method with the motors mounted on the rotating plate is the best method for changing the elevation angle of the solar
	collector.

<h5> Solar Collector Mount</h5>

As the solar collector shell will be built from hardening resin and burlap, we have determined that we can 3D print our
	mounting brackets and directly set the brackets into the resin as it hardens to attach the brackets to the solar
	collector. The main design constraint beyond the need to fit onto the collector and to hold the axel was that the
	bracket should be designed in such a way that the collector could be detached from the axel without having to pull
	the axel out through both brackets.

The simplest solution to this was to design the mounting brackets in a manner similar to C-clamps, with a screw applying
	pressure to the axel once it has slotted into its mounting point

Additionally, we have determined that the support structure for the dish itself should be made from aluminum extrusions,
	with pillow bearings to support the axel mounted on top. A sketch of this is shown below and the 3D modelling of this
	support method is shown above.

An alternate method which could be potentially simpler to construct though would be less structurally sound would be to
	construct the supports out of 2"x4" pieces of lumber and mount ball bearings directly into the supports as shown in
	the sketch below.
